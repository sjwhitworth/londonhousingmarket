D3 + Python
===================

A simple visualisation of London's housing market data.<br>
To run locally, run londonhousing.py to generate the JSON needed for D3 to do it's thing.<br>
Then, run a HTTP server locally via Python - <b>sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 &</b> - and browse to londonhousingdata.html on your filesystem.<br>
You must have topojson installed for the conversion to work - see here for how to install. http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/
